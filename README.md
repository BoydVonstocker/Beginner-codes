2. **Data Transformation:**
   - Split multi-valued fields (e.g., actors and genres) into individual entries.
   - Exploded lists into separate rows for analysis.

3. **Data Analysis:**
   - Used pandas for data manipulation and calculations.
   - Extracted insights such as averages, counts, and unique values.
